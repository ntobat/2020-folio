      <h3 class="el el-sub">CONTEXT</h3>
      <p class="content el">The resettlement process for a refugee is a long one, often beginning with a catastrophe or some terrible event forcing the refugee to flee. They may not have time to gather the whole family, or retrieve important documents such as property ownership documents, birth certificates and IDs, etc. And once they arrive in a camp, access to the Internet is often limited or entirely unavailable.</p>

        <span class="sub-bolded">CONSIDERATIONS</span><br>
        The phone had to withstand rugged outdoor conditions and cross-country travel, as well as operate hyper-efficiently for users who often go long periods without access to charging.
        <br><br>
      <span class="sub-bolded">OUTCOMES</span><br>
        The phones are built to military standards, with Corning Gorilla Glass DX (the glare-resistant glass used on smart watches) and a protective non-slip rubber casing. The phones use eInk technology to render the UI, saving on both manufacturing costs and processing power by foregoing colors and animations. See the full technical specifications below.

        <span class="sub-bolded">CONSIDERATIONS</span><br>
        There were three main constraints to consider in developing the UI for the phones: the Google design system, eInk technology, and efficiency. Additionally, knowing the vast majority of camp populations speak Arabic as their first language, the default language is Arabic and all of the text and UI elements are laid out right to left.
        <br><br>
      <span class="sub-bolded">OUTCOMES</span><br>
        The phones ship with six apps — pictured above — selected for their utility when it comes to the resettlement process<!--: Chrome for internet browsing; Gmail for email access and communication; Maps for navigation; Drive for file storage; Translate for language barriers; and WhatsApp for its prevalence as the main texting app among the target population-->. Everything is rendered in grayscale due to the eInk technology. The phone UI and app UIs are all faithful to Google’s design system and the Pixel 2 UI.

      <p class="content el">
        The project began with a topic assignment: the refugee crisis. Our first task, then, was to figure out exactly which sub-problem we wanted to tackle within the larger topic. We established a long list of possibilities by reading countless articles and interviews with past and current refugees, listening to relevant podcast episodes, and researching both UN and US policy documents related to refugees.

      <h3 class="el el-sub">INSIGHT</h3>
      <p class="content el">
        As we sifted through the piles of data we collected, one statistic from the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) practically leapt off the page:
        <br><br>
        <span class="emphasis">Refugees often spend a third of their income on staying connected.</span>
        <br>
        And as we further explored the relationship between refugees and communication/connectivity, the role and value of internet access and smartphones in their lives became increasingly apparent. The quote below speaks for itself.
      </p>

      <div class="content el" style="grid-row: 2;">
        <blockquote class="quote">See why this phone is so dear? It has everything. All my family, all my world is here. That's why I'm always holding&nbsp;it.</blockquote>

      <h3 class="el el-sub">BIG IDEA</h3>
      <p class="content el">
        Along with the above quotes and statistic, we learned that refugees are about half as likely as the general population to own a phone, and that roughly 30% of refugee households do not even own a phone.
        <br><br>If phones are often more important than food and water, it was hard for us to imagine how those refugees without access felt — and we wanted to help. This led us to our big idea:
        <br><br>
        <span class="emphasis">Provide refugees with smartphones and internet access.</span>
        <br>
        Which, of course, is far easier said than done. But it is a noble goal, and it is directly relevant to the UNHCR directive laid out in their 2016 connectivity report:
      </p>

      <div class="content el" style="grid-row: 2;">
        <blockquote class="quote">UNHCR believes we can do better. Through creative partnerships and smart investments, UNHCR aims to ensure that all refugees, and the communities that host them, are connected to mobile networks and the internet so that they can leverage these technologies to improve their&nbsp;lives.</blockquote>

        We eliminated Apple first, due to their irrelevant brand mission and closed ecosystem of products and software. Additionally, refugees already tend to use cheap Android smartphone models and are likely more familiar with the Android operating system.

        Google was chosen over Samsung due to the fact that they developed the Android operating system and their history of refugee relief efforts, including device donations and sending volunteers to install WiFi in refugee camps.

        <span class="bolded">IT'S A WIN-WIN-WIN!</span><br>
        In order for this plan to work, we had to be sure that all parties involved were benefiting in some way — or else refugees wouldn't use it, Google wouldn't pay for it, and the UNHCR wouldn't allow&nbsp;it.
        <br><br><span class="sub-bolded">REFUGEES</span><br>
        Refugees are provided free phones, free WiFi, and free charging (at the Refuge Beacon). The apps included are vital to sharing information, traveling between safe locations, communicating with family members, and organizing important documents for the resettlement process. Additionally, as a congratulations for successful resettlement, they are granted a free Pixel phone from&nbsp;Google.
        <br><br><span class="sub-bolded">UNHCR</span><br>
        The UNHCR explicitly states in their report that they are seeking "engagement of the private sector – in particular, large technology companies and mobile network operators – if we are to achieve this vision." If Google were to enact this solution, it would be exactly the kind of private sector support they are looking&nbsp;for.
        <br><br><span class="sub-bolded">GOOGLE</span><br>
        While the benefits to Google may have a hard time outweighing the costs financially, they will gain an admirable and invaluable social good reputation. Additionally, this gives them a chance to expand their user base among a less-represented population and develop innovative solutions for those in&nbsp;need.

        In order to frame the idea as something realistically possible, we needed to develop assets showing how it could work. These included 3D models of the phone & beacon, a UI prototype of the phone, a campaign website, and a concept video. You can see the finished products in the first three sections&nbsp;above.
