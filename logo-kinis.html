        <h2 id="ask" style="font-weight: 700; font-family: 'Crete Round';">The Ask</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I was tasked with creating a comprehensive Brand Identity for a small barefoot apparel startup company in Richmond, VA. The first and most pressing piece of the identity was the logo.</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2 id="proc" style="font-weight: 700; font-family: 'Crete Round';">The Process <span style="font-size: .5em; font-family: 'PT Sans';">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;JUMP TO <a href="#result">RESULT</a></span></h2>
        <br>
        <p>The first thing the client wanted was a new logo. This is what they had:</p>
        <div class="proc-img"><img src="assets/kinis/logo_old.png" /><img class="tooltip" src="assets/kinis/logo_old.png"></div>
        <p>Seeing as they produce barefoot training footwear, I assumed the shape was meant to resemble a foot. I was wrong: it's a calf muscle.
        So for the new logo, they wanted to stick with the kinesiology / human body theme. After some initial sketches and digital experiments ...</p>
        <div class="proc-img"><img src="assets/kinis/sketch.jpg" /><img class="tooltip" src="assets/kinis/sketch.jpg" /></div>
        <div class="proc-img"><img src="assets/kinis/sketch-ad.png" /><img class="tooltip" src="assets/kinis/sketch-ad.png" /></div>
        <p>... I found something I liked. I formed a "K" with the natural outline of a barefoot footprint and used a red color very similar to the old logo to accentuate the toe prints.</p>
        <div class="proc-img"><img src="assets/kinis/logo_v1.png" /><img class="tooltip" src="assets/kinis/logo_v1.png" /></div>
        <p>It was ultimately rejected because the client hopes to eventually expand from solely (ha! get it?) footwear to full body apparel, and the footprint logo could end up being limiting. Something good came out of it, though, because I was trying out fonts to go along with the logo and stumbled across Arista Pro, which went with my foot fairly well. I used that as a basis for developing my custom wordmark, which the client absolutely loves.</p>
        <div class="proc-img"><img src="assets/kinis/wordmark.png" /><img class="tooltip" src="assets/kinis/wordmark.png" /></div>
        <p>As for the logo, though, it was back to the drawing board. Upon nixing the footprint idea, the client asked for "something simple, like the Nike swoosh." Right.</p>
        <br>
        <p>When I heard the client's (eventual) expansion plans, all I could think about was somehow showing a full human body in the logo. After many, many, many iterations, I came up with this:</p>
        <div class="proc-img"><img src="assets/kinis/logo_pad.png" /><img class="tooltip" src="assets/kinis/logo_pad.png" /></div>
        <p>This logo depicts a human figure set against a red rounded-corner square. The forward tilt of the figure gives off an impression of motion, while the rounded stroke matches the wordmark. The red & white contrast nicely with the black of the wordmark.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This logo also works quite well because of its relation to the heart of what Kinis is all about. To put it briefly, Kinis believes that the human foot is a biomechanical masterpiece and stuffing it into a shoe negates its natural function. This logo hearkens back to the time of our species' distant ancestors&mdash;before the concept of a shoe existed, and everyone was barefoot&mdash;and the figure paintings found on the walls of caves.</p>
