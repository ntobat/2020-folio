<h1>Utilization Reports</h1>
<p class="descr">
    The majority of Backbone's clients are apparel companies. Our users needed a way to display a selected set of
    components — the building blocks of products, such as buttons, zippers, and fabrics — in a dynamic,
    exportable&nbsp;report to help with Purchase Orders and product planning.
</p>

<section>
    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>Utilization reports are a fairly common feature across different PLMs — in fact, an earlier version of Backbone
        had them, and our users were repeatedly asking for them in 2.0. Developing a highly intuitive reporting
        interface was a top priority for both the business and our user base.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>Luckily, we had an older requirements doc from 1.0 that helped to inform a lot of my initial direction. I also
        jumped into 1.0 to play around with the feature, noting interactions and jotting down my thoughts about the user
        experience. I worked with our wonderful CX lead to run a few Q&A sessions with our users to speak about their
        wants, needs, and biases.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once I was confident in my knowledge of the problem, it was time to start drawing rectangles on screens! I used
        our Wireframe Kit to map out some initial explorations. A lot of the head-scratching came from determining how
        best to filter on the entire dataset.</p>

    <h3>Product</h3>
    <p>The main task was to simplify the complex. I broke out the filters from our traditional side-drawer and sectioned
        them out onto the Report Creation page with descriptive tooltips explaining how the underlying boolean logic
        works. Some decisions were made to curtail user control in favor of guardrails, ultimately increasing ease of
        use by not having every possible option always available.</p>

    <h3>1. Report Library</h3>
    <p>The report library serves as the landing page for this feature and houses all utilization reports created by
        or shared with the current user.</p>

    <h3>2. Report Creation</h3>
    <p>Here, the user decides which components to include in the report, using both component- and product-level
        attributes. I reimagined our (admittedly bug-riddled) filtering UI/UX to implement a simple, section-based
        filtering system with informative tooltips to let the user know how the report is generated in the back-end.

    <h3>3. Report Generation</h3>
    <p>Reports are generated with a set of features to give the user ultimate control over the data displayed. These
        features include searching, sorting, filtering, and column management. While many of these patterns are
        reusable components found elsewhere in the app, I developed the column manager specifically for this reporting
        module.</p>
