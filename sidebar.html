      <p>If you’re alive and reading this, you know that American politics are chaotic, convoluted, and often just plain crazy. The situation isn't helped much by Americans' <a class="inlink" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/06/americans-vs-basic-historical-knowledge/340761/" target="_blank">lack of civic knowledge</a>. Crooked Media is a liberal political media company with a host of podcasts that aims to promote open conversation and support political participation. They wanted to provide an opportunity for users to educate themselves about how our government really works. By strengthening their listeners' foundation of political knowledge, they hoped to increase the value of their media offerings.</p>

      <p>The biggest challenge was interesting people in a topic that, on the face of it, appears esoteric, complex, and just plain boring. AMERICA 2050 circumvents the usual barriers to entry around understanding the US government by gamifying the learning process.</p>

      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="concept">CONCEPT</h2>
      <p>Crooked Media is well poised, as a platform for political engagement, to offer educational content in an appealing way to their young & liberal demographic. This content will both support Crooked Media's goal of a well-informed and politically proactive public, but also drive up listener numbers and online engagement in a positive feedback loop.<br><br>AMERICA 2050 is a web-based gaming platform. Upon signing in, the user is greeted with a welcome message explaining the premise: it is 2050, and anyone with enough money now has the ability to purchase laws. The user plays a variety of arcade-style games to collect coins and buy laws, which are used to unlock new levels, games, and achievements, and attain a spot on the leaderboard. The tone is clearly satirical, matching the humorous dialogue in Crooked Media's podcasts. As you can see in the below example of one of the games, the user gains coins by whacking scientists who believe in climate change. At the end of each game, the user is given background information about the issue and opportunities to get involved.</p>

    <div class="research section">
      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="research">RESEARCH</h2>
      <p>Our research was primarily conducted online and supported by candid conversations with the target audience we identified. Our key findings didn't reveal any groundbreaking insight, but served to remind us of the breadth of the problem we were trying to solve. We organized the many facets of the issue at hand into four categories:</p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Voter apathy</li>
          <li>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;General & specific lack of political knowledge</li>
          <li>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Politics, as a subject, is "lame"</li>
          <li>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;US government is incredibly complex</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Phew, that is a lot to tackle. Our initial explorations largely focused on #2, giving rise to ideas such as: a "Guess Who?" game for politicians; a localized issue-tracking app (<a class="inlink" target="_blank" href="http://countable.us">already exists</a>); politician trading cards; and a Build-Your-Own Political Platform competition among schools. Unfortunately, these initial ideas all suffered from the lame-ness that seems inextricably linked to all things political. Our biggest takeaway was nothing new: <span class="bold">gamification makes boring stuff fun!</span></p>

    <div class="persona section">
      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="persona">PERSONA</h2>
      <p>Crafting a user persona for this project was fairly easy, given the Crooked Media listenership demographics. Jill Abramson, former NY Times editor and current Guardian contributor, summed it up thusly:</p>
      <p class="indent">“They have the young liberal demographic sewn up in the same way Jon Stewart did on cable in 2000." (<a class="inlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/09/pod-save-america-podcast-european-tour-jon-favreau-obama">source</a>)</p>
      <p>Basically, we were targeting young left-leaning millennials, perhaps entering the political fray for the first time, likely feeling disenchanted with Trump-era politics, and exhibiting a desire to fight for change or at least willing to educate themselves and stay up to date on what's happening. Here's Troy:
