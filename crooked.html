Upon signing in, the user is greeted with a welcome message explaining the premise: it is 2050, and anyone with enough money now has the ability to purchase laws. The user plays a variety of arcade-style games to collect coins and buy laws, which are used to unlock new levels, games, and achievements, and attain a spot on the leaderboard. The tone is clearly satirical, matching the humorous dialogue in Crooked Media's podcasts.</p>

        <span class="sub-bolded">CONSIDERATIONS</span><br>
        Taking into account the time frame of the project, we had to decide upon a single game to fully develop for the presentation. The key consideration in this area was to create something fun and engaging with the educational aspect almost a side-effect of the overall experience. Simplicity and familiarity will go a long way towards user engagement.
        <br><br>
        <span class="sub-bolded">OUTCOMES</span><br>
        We chose climate change as the topic for the flagship game: everyone is familiar with the controversy and likely has their own opinions on it, and it is an area of politics that will be at the forefront of public discussion for many election cycles to come. We adapted a whack-a-mole style game where the player smacks vocal climate change scientists for cash. Each play-through ends with an information panel that explains the connection between the game and real-world events and offers additional links to Crooked Media content and elsewhere.

        <span class="sub-bolded">CONSIDERATIONS</span><br>
        We wanted to keep the platform's branding in alignment with Crooked Media for familiarity's sake (we expect most users to arrive at the site from a Crooked Media offering), while endowing it with something unique to establish it as its own entity. Explorations included the United States' <a class="inlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#Colors" target="_blank">official color palette</a>, old video games, and of course Crooked Media's own branding.
        <br><br>
        <span class="sub-bolded">OUTCOMES</span><br>
        Ultimately, we decided to move ahead with a slightly modified Crooked Media color palette and an 8-bit pixel art style. The 8-bit style was chosen to provide a level of abstraction from political reality as well as a callback to the target audience’s younger days and the video games of the 80s and 90s.

        Our research was primarily conducted online and supported by candid conversations with the target audience we identified. Our key findings didn't reveal any groundbreaking insight, but served to remind us of the breadth of the problem we were trying to solve. We organized the many facets of the issue at hand into four categories:
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li>1. &nbsp;&nbsp;Voter apathy</li>
          <li>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;General & specific lack of political knowledge</li>
          <li>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;Politics, as a subject, is "lame"</li>
          <li>4. &nbsp;&nbsp;The US government is incredibly complex</li>

      </div>
      <div class="row el">
        <h3 class="el el-sub">INSIGHT</h3>
        <p class="content el">
          Many of our initial ideas unfortunately suffered from the lame-ness that seems inextricably linked to all things political, but we noticed a trend among the few that were more plausible: they involved some sort of game or reward component. It seemed the only way to combat political ennui.
          <br><br>
          <span class="emphasis">Gamification makes less-fun stuff more&nbsp;fun!</span>
          <br>
          Our initial explorations gave rise to ideas such as: a "Guess Who?" game for politicians; a localized issue-tracking app with participation rewards(<a class="inlink" target="_blank" href="http://countable.us">already exists</a>); politician trading cards; and a Build-Your-Own Political Platform competition among schools.

          Basically, we were targeting young left-leaning millennials, perhaps entering the political fray for the first time, likely feeling disenchanted with Trump-era politics, and exhibiting a desire to fight for change or at least willing to educate themselves and stay up to date on what's happening. Here's Troy:

        <span class="bolded">AMERICA 2050: A RETRO-FUTURISTIC DYSTOPIAN WORLD</span><br>
        In sum, we were designing an educational tool for young liberals who, while ostensibly concerned with the state of politics in America, are likely shockingly ignorant of the political system itself. There are many reasons for this ignorance, and our solution must sidestep these obstacles by correctly applying the principles of gamification to drive engagement and subvert the “politics = boring” mindset. I brought the core idea to a team meeting, and together, we developed the full concept:
        <br><br>

              Just a few decades from now, Trump-era politics have become the norm. The American government has shed its mask of democracy and the real lawmaking mechanism has been laid bare: cash money. Lobbying is now the fastest growing and most profitable profession, and you are but one of thousands of eager young grads trying to make a buck. AMERICA 2050 is a gaming platform set in a not-too-distant dystopian future where users play as villainous lobbyists trying to get their crooked agendas through Congress.The various games tackle different issues that our nation is currently dealing with, from an exaggerated and satirical standpoint. The user plays games to collect coins and buy laws, which unlock new games and increase their standing on the&nbsp;leaderboard.
