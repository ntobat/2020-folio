        <p>I’m Nick! Affectionately, I’m Nicky. Physically, I'm a 5’10” male with glasses, a gap-toothed smile, and a lean build. Emotionally, I’m a placid lake protected by a serene forest — rarely is my surface disturbed. Academically, I’m a dedicated life-long learner, a porous sponge absorbing everything in reach. Socially, I teeter between extroversion and introversion, and I don’t much care to take a Meyers-Briggs test and put myself in a box. Philosophically, I consider myself an absurd existentialist — aware of the universe’s indifference towards me, and happy to create and pursue my own meaning of life. Gradually, I'm discovering that “who I am” is a fluid concept, impossible to pin down in a paragraph, or ten paragraphs, as my body and mind grow and change with each passing day.</p>

        <p>Oh boy. I'm an extreme dabbler. I'm just gonna throw a list in here, in the order that it pops into my brain. Here goes:</p>
        <ol class="list">
          <li>Rock climbing</li>
          <li>The great outdoors</li>
          <li>Philosophy</li>
          <li>Design</li>
          <li>Food! Man I love food.</li>
          <li>Running</li>
          <li>Travel</li>
          <li>TV & Movies</li>
          <li>Making (woodworking, crafting, DIYing)</li>
          <li>Reading</li>
          <li>Writing</li>
          <li>Doodling</li>
          <li>Environmentalism</li>
          <li>Dreams</li>
          <li>Fashion</li>
          <li>Science & Technology</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Ok I'll stop there. The list goes on, believe me, but I think you get the idea. I suppose you might call me a dilettante, and you wouldn't be too far off, though I am constantly working to upgrade my classification to polymath.

        <p>Isn't that a great word? Sadly, it seems to be well on its way to earning the "archaic" tag in modern dictionaries. Ah well — progress is impossible without change, and we humans are all about progress, isn't that right?</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, what have I been up to up to now? Let's start somewhere in the middle, shall we? I graduated from the University of Virginia in 2014 with a degree in Foreign Affairs that I had no intention of taking advantage of. In fact, I was quite unsure of what to do next, my education having assured me only that my chosen field of study was a terrible bore [subjective opinion alert]. Luckily, I was still in contact with a good friend who worked in San Francisco as a technical recruiter. A couple of phone calls and a six-hour plane ride later, I was sitting down to coffee with his boss having an almost reverse-interview experience. I barely got a word in edgewise before he stood up and said, "See ya Monday bright and early."</p>
        <br>
        <p>It didn't last very long, but this first job out of school was the key to my future. I was blasted headfirst into the epicenter of technology and design, a world I had hitherto blissfully ignored (there's that word again!). There I was, conducting boolean searches on LinkedIn for terms like "HTML" and "REST API" and "UI/UX" and filling openings with $100K+ salaries. You may be able to guess what happened next, as it is particularly un-unique to San Fran transplants — I started to teach myself how to code. I figured I could get a hang of the basics pretty quickly — did I mention I'm a fast learner? — and slide neatly into one of these jobs I was recruiting for.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Of course, that's not exactly what happened. My girlfriend reconnected with the Australian half of her family on a Christmas trip to Scotland, and a couple of months later I found myself on a plane to Adelaide, South Australia, by way of Moscow, Madrid, Strasburg, Traun, Berlin, Prague, Kalamata, Athens, Mumbai, Vientiane, and finally Bali. All of a sudden I was a well-traveled cosmopolitan expatriate, three parts of speech that had never before described me. This is the route I took across the world in early 2015:</p>

        <br>
        <p>I eked out a living with freelance web design work, and my girlfriend out-earned me by far teaching yoga to yuppies. Together, we had enough to survive fairly comfortably. We lucked into an incredible old house with lots of character (i.e. stains, cracks, and holes), a massive garden full of fruit and veg, a few productive hens, and some absolute legend roommates. It was a grand old time, believe me.</p>
        <br>
        <p>All told, I spent about 14 months down under. And I'll write the rest of this story later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Anyway, I made my way into the VCU Brandcenter and am now enrolled in the Experience Design track, making lots of cool stuff and collaborating with all sorts of talented folks.</p>
