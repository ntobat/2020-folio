        <br>
        <p>Kinis is a barefoot apparel startup in Richmond, VA. I was brought on by Kinis to develop their brand identity and style guide. I began the process with an audit of the current styles and assets. I was assured nothing was set in stone, but they liked certain aspects of what they currently had, especially the Kinis red color.</p>

          <h3 class="sec-title">AUDIT</h3>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>I was provided access to their CMS and began poking around. They had a logo they weren't in love with, mostly consistent styling, a few non-professional product shots, and not much else.</p>
        <div class="imgblock">
          <img src="../assets/kinis/logo_old.png" />
          <img src="../assets/kinis/sock.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>I gathered the assets I deemed most useful and decided to begin the brand identity design with a new logo. The logo is a very good place to start because many of the decisions made there have a direct impact on other aspects of a brand identity, such as colors and fonts.</p>

        <div class="title" id="k-logo">
          <h3 class="sec-title">LOGO</h3>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>Their old logo, pictured above, was supposed to represent a calf muscle. Could have fooled me—I assumed it was an abstract footprint or maybe a sock, given the company's product offering. I was provided some guidelines for developing the new logo:</p>
        <p class="indent">"No strong ties to colors/fonts. Let's keep it muscle / foot / anatomy / kinesiology inspired."</p>
        <p>After some inital sketching and experimentation—mostly just various styles of footprints—I found something I liked. Forming a "K" with the natural outline of a bare foot, this concept uses flowing curves to represent movement and the toe prints are accentuated with the Kinis red color.</p>
        <div class="imgblock">
          <img src="../assets/kinis/logo_v1.png" />
        </div>
        <p>This concept was ultimately rejected because Kinis hopes to eventually expand into full body apparel and they don't want the logo to limit their vision. Something good came out of it, however, which I will go into further in the Wordmark section. Upon nixing this first concept, the client elaborated on the initial ask:</p>
        <p class="indent">"Make it something simple, like the Nike swoosh."</p>
        <p>Right.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Once I was informed of their plans for eventual expansion, I focused on the idea of showing a full human body in the logo. After a whole lot of trial and error finding ways to depict a human body in a "K" shape, I landed on this cute guy:</p>
        <div class="imgblock">
          <img src="../assets/kinis/k-logo.png" />
        </div>
        <p>Seeing as I had already presented the client a logo built out of the letter K, I thought it would be prudent to include a new concept for the second round. For this concept, I wanted to give off a feeling of movement while keeping with the familiar shape of the human body. The result:</p>
        <div class="imgblock">
          <img src="../assets/kinis/logo_pad.png" />
        </div>
