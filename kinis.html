    <div class="section section-1">
      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="threec">THREE C's</h2>
      <h3 class="subSecHead">1. CONTEXT</h3>
      <p>Kinis is a barefoot apparel startup based in Richmond, VA. They launched with a prototype and a mission: raise awareness about the benefits of barefoot exercise and equip people with the footwear necessary to make the switch. They sell a line of high-performance socks and padded barefoot training socks. I was brought on to develop their brand identity and style guide.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-2">
      <h3 class="subSecHead">2. CHALLENGE</h3>
      <p>The challenge was to translate a core belief and physical product into a visual form. The founder was extremely passionate about his product and mission, and he had some initial assets to work off of, but he was not great at articulating his vision for the brand identity. We quested through many rounds of feedback and revision to discover the perfect visual manifestation of Kinis.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section section-3">
      <h3 class="subSecHead">3. CONCEPT</h3>
      <p>Kinis is all about the future of exercise and the movement to barefoot training. Much of the research supporting barefoot exercise hearkens to the habits and practices of our ancestors, who lived their entire lives sans shoes. Thusly, the brand identity pays homage to early human cave art while utilizing sleek and modern curves to link past and future.</p>

    <div class="section section-5">
      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="research">LOGO</h2>
      <p>The logo seemed a natural place to begin. Although the product was footwear, I wanted to experiment with the inclusion of a full human body in the logo. The completed design depicts a human figure set against a red rounded-corner square. The forward tilt of the figure gives off an impression of motion, while the rounded stroke matches the wordmark and contributes to the impression of sleek efficiency.</p>
      <br>
      <p>This logo also works quite well because of its relation to the heart of what Kinis is all about. To put it briefly, Kinis believes that the human foot is a biomechanical masterpiece and stuffing it into a shoe negates its natural function. This logo hearkens back to the time of our species' distant ancestors&mdash;before the concept of a shoe existed, and everyone was barefoot&mdash;and the figure paintings found on the walls of caves.</p>

      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="persona">THE REST: COMING SOON. VERY SOON.</h2>
      <!--p>Crafting a user persona for this project was fairly easy, given the Crooked Media listenership demographics. Jill Abramson, former NY Times editor and current Guardian contributor, summed it up thusly:</p>
      <p class="indent">“They have the young liberal demographic sewn up in the same way Jon Stewart did on cable in 2000." (<a class="inlink" target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/09/pod-save-america-podcast-european-tour-jon-favreau-obama">source</a>)</p>
      <p>Basically, we were targeting young left-leaning millennials, perhaps entering the political fray for the first time, likely feeling disenchanted with Trump-era politics, and exhibiting a desire to fight for change or at least willing to educate themselves and stay up to date on what's happening. Here's Troy:-->

      <p>Gosh, Troy is such a classic Millenial. Handsome, too.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section section-9">
      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="conclusions">CONCLUSIONS</h2>
      <p>We were designing an educational tool for young liberals who, while ostensibly concerned with the state of politics in America, are likely shockingly ignorant of the political system itself. There are many reasons for this ignorance, and our solution must sidestep these obstacles by correctly applying the principles of gamification to drive engagement and subvert the “politics = boring” mindset.</p>
      <br>
      <p>With all of this in mind, AMERICA 2050 was born — a gaming platform set in a not-too-distant dystopian future, where users play as villainous lobbyists trying to get their crooked agendas through Congress. The American government has shed its mask of democracy and the real lawmaking mechanism has been laid bare: cash money. The various games tackle different issues that our nation is currently dealing with, from an exaggerated and satirical standpoint. The user plays games to collect coins and buy laws, which unlock new games and increase their standing on the leaderboard.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section section-10">
      <h2 class="secHead anchor" id="design">DESIGN</h2>
      <h3 class="subSecHead">1. CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
      <p>While education was the ultimate goal, it was not what would bring users to the table. The key consideration here was to create something fun and engaging with the educational aspect almost a side-effect of the overall experience. We also needed to break the complex topic into manageable chunks. And, of course, we had to consider the user’s knowledge base and the best way to use gamification to bridge the gap.</p>
      <br>
      <h3 class="subSecHead">2. EXPLORATION</h3>
      <p>We looked at a diverse array of sources for inspiration, including the United States' <a class="inlink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_the_United_States#Colors" target="_blank">official color palette</a>, old video games, and of course Crooked Media itself.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section section-12">
      <p>Ultimately, we decided to move ahead with a slightly modified Crooked Media color palette and an 8-bit pixel art style. Both of these decisions were rooted in familiarity — we anticipated the vast majority of users to discover the platform via Crooked Media, and using the same color palette would help link the two in their minds. The 8-bit style was chosen to provide a level of abstraction from political reality as well as a callback to the target audience’s younger days and the video games of the 80s and 90s.</p>
